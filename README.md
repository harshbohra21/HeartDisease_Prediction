This contains a python notebook outlining the entire process of developing models for a given dataset. I have used the HeartDisease 2020 dataset from Kaggle and have performed the following operations on it:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**
* **Data Preprocessing**
    * Missing Value Analysis
    * Duplicates
    * Outlier Analysis
    * Feature Selection
    * Encoding
    * Standardization
    * Test Train Split
    * Class Balancing
* **Model Development**
    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * Naive Bayes
    * K-Nearest Neighbours
    * Support Vector Machine
